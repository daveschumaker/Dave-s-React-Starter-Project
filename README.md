# Dave's React Starter Project

I love working with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), but man oh man is it a production to get setup and running. I've found that if I want to quicky hack on a project, I end up spending a whole day reading about the latest changes to various libraries, and rolling together my own fresh new install. By the time I have everything setup and running, I've lost the ambition to continue working on my original idea!

This repo hopes to mitigate the pain of setup. Mostly, it's customized for me, but you might find it useful, too. There are a number of [great React Starter projects](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) floating around that are much better than this. That said, this is my project that serves two purposes:

1. Learn more about setting up React projects from scratch.
2. Be able to quickly roll out new projects using React.

If you'd like to learn more about putting together your own React project from scratch, check out [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/), a fantastic resource.
